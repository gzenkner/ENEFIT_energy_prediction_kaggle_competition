Solving business problems with ML.

This is my submission for the ENEFIT Kaggle competition hosted in December 2023. ENEFIT if one of largest energy suppliers in Estonia and the problem they have come to the Kaggle community for is predicting the amount of energy prosumers (producers + consumers) generate and consume on an hourly basis. Prosumers are those that have photovoltaic solar systems set up to feed energy back into the grid. The supply and demand depends on many factors such as the past weather, the future weather, the price of electricity and gas, the region and other customer-specific information and is extremely volatile.
